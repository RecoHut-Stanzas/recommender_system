Go you! As a critical component of this project, you'd like to first build a car detection system. To collect data, you've mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds as you drive around. \n","\n","<caption><center> Pictures taken from a car-mounted camera while driving around Silicon Valley. <br> Dataset provided by <a href=\"https://www.drive.ai/\">drive.ai</a>.\n","</center></caption>\n","\n","You've gathered all these images into a folder and labelled them by drawing bounding boxes around every car you found.

The video lectures used the latter representation; in this notebook, you'll use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.  \n","\n","In this exercise, you'll discover how YOLO (\"You Only Look Once\") performs object detection, and then apply it to car detection.

This algorithm \"only looks once\" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.\n","\n","## 3.1 - Model Details\n","\n","### Inputs and outputs\n","- The **input** is a batch of images, and each image has the shape (m, 608, 608, 3)\n","- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers. \n","\n","### Anchor Boxes\n","* Anchor boxes are chosen by exploring the training data to choose reasonable height/width ratios that represent the different classes.  For this assignment, 5 anchor boxes were chosen for you (to cover the 80 classes), and stored in the file './model_data/yolo_anchors.txt'\n","* The dimension for anchor boxes is the second to last dimension in the encoding: $(m, n_H,n_W,anchors,classes)$.\n","* The YOLO architecture is: IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP CNN -> ENCODING (m, 19, 19, 5, 85).  \n","\n","\n","### Encoding\n","Let's look in greater detail at what this encoding represents. \n","\n","<caption><center> <u><b> Figure 2 </u></b>: Encoding architecture for YOLO<br> </center></caption>\n","\n","If the center/midpoint of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XtnmzKMAok1U"},"source":["### Class score\n","\n","Now, for each box (of each cell) you'll compute the following element-wise product and extract a probability that the box contains a certain class.  \n","The class score is $score_{c,i} = p_{c} \\times c_{i}$: the probability that there is an object $p_{c}$ times the probability that the object is a certain class $c_{i}$.\n","\n","<caption><center> <u><b>Figure 4</u></b>: Find the class detected by each box<br> </center></caption>\n","\n","#### Example of figure 4\n","* In figure 4, let's say for box 1 (cell 1), the probability that an object exists is $p_{1}=0.60$.  So there's a 60% chance that an object exists in box 1 (cell 1).  \n","* The probability that the object is the class \"category 3 (a car)\" is $c_{3}=0.73$.  \n","* The score for box 1 and for category \"3\" is $score_{1,3}=0.60 \\times 0.73 = 0.44$.  \n","* Let's say you calculate the score for all 80 classes in box 1, and find that the score for the car class (class 3) is the maximum.
