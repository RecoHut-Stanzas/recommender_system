Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers (pc,bx,by,bh,bw,c) as explained above. If you expand c into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers.\n","We will use 5 anchor boxes. So you can think of the YOLO architecture as the following: IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP CNN -> ENCODING (m, 19, 19, 5, 85).\n","Filtering with a threshold on class scores\n","You are going to apply a first filter by thresholding. You would like to get rid of any box for which the class \"score\" is less than a chosen threshold.\n","The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85 numbers. It'll be convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425)) dimensional tensor into the following variables:\n","    box_confidence: tensor of shape (19×19,5,1) containing pc (confidence probability that there's some object) for each of the 5 boxes predicted in each of the 19x19 cells.\n","    boxes: tensor of shape (19×19,5,4) containing (bx,by,bh,bw) for each of the 5 boxes per cell.\n","    box_class_probs: tensor of shape (19×19,5,80) containing the detection probabilities (c1,c2,...,c80) for each of the 80 classes for each of the 5 boxes per cell.\n","'''\n","\n","'''\n","Exercise: Implement iou(). Some hints:\n","    In this exercise only, we define a box using its two corners (upper left and lower right): (x1, y1, x2, y2) rather than the midpoint and height/width.\n","    To calculate the area of a rectangle you need to multiply its height (y2 - y1) by its width (x2 - x1)\n","    You'll also need to find the coordinates (xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2) of the intersection of two boxes.
