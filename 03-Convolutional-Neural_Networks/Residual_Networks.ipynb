A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow.\n","\n","* More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode,\" from gaining very large values). \n","\n","* During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the shallower layers decrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds, as shown below: "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sS7D-a3nGKfE"},"source":["# 3 - Building a Residual Network\n","\n","In ResNets, a \"shortcut\" or a \"skip connection\" allows the model to skip layers:  \n","\n","The image on the left shows the \"main path\" through the network.
