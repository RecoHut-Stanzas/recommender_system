It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output). \n","\n","* However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow.\n","\n","* More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode,\" from gaining very large values). \n","\n","* During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the shallower layers decrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds, as shown below: "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sS7D-a3nGKfE"},"source":["# 3 - Building a Residual Network\n","\n","In ResNets, a \"shortcut\" or a \"skip connection\" allows the model to skip layers:  \n","\n","The image on the left shows the \"main path\" through the network. The image on the right adds a shortcut to the main path. By stacking these ResNet blocks on top of each other, you can form a very deep network. \n","\n","The lecture mentioned that having ResNet blocks with the shortcut also makes it very easy for one of the blocks to learn an identity function. This means that you can stack on additional ResNet blocks with little risk of harming training set performance.  \n","    \n","On that note, there is also some evidence that the ease of learning an identity function accounts for ResNets' remarkable performance even more than skip connections help with vanishing gradients.\n","\n","Two main types of blocks are used in a ResNet, depending mainly on whether the input/output dimensions are the same or different.

To flesh out the different steps of what happens in a ResNet's identity block, here is an alternative diagram showing the individual steps:\n","\n","The upper path is the \"shortcut path.\" The lower path is the \"main path.\" In this diagram, notice the CONV2D and ReLU steps in each layer. To speed up training, a BatchNorm step has been added. Don't worry about this being complicated to implement--you'll see that BatchNorm is just one line of code in Keras! \n","\n","In this exercise, you'll actually implement a slightly more powerful version of this identity block, in which the skip connection \"skips over\" 3 hidden layers rather than 2 layers.
